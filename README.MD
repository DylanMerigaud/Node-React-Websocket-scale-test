# Node-React-Websocket-scale-test

## Test it locally

Create a new file `./backend/.env` by taking `./backend/.env.example` as example.
Install depencies by running `yarn install` at the root of the project.
Test by running `yarn start`.
It should open 2 new tabs in your browser, which must be sync.

## Demo

You can test it without running locally. It's hosted on free tier heroku so you it should take some time to warmup.
